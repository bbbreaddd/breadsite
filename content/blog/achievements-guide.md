title: 'Pirated Games Achievements Guide'
---

Here is a guide on how to see achievements you've unlocked with pirated games using Achievement Watcher and Goldberg.
<!--more-->  
Achievement Watcher can also do achievement notifications, clips, and screenshots to make it seem more official. This is my personal method, and it's been pretty reliable. While it might seem like a lot due to the pictures and number of steps, I just tried to be as specific as possible.

## 1. Get your Steam API Key

(no it's not my real API key)  

## 2. Download and Extract Steam-Auto-Crack

Download the latest `SteamAutoCrack.zip`  
<https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/Steam-auto-crack/releases>  

Extract it and run `SteamAutoCrack.exe`  

## 3. Using SteamAutoCrack

SteamAutoCrack can seem overwhelming, but there are only a few options you need to mess with.  

### 3a. Change your Settings

Press the Settings button (1) and make sure to enable `Save Config File` (2), and then make sure to update Goldberg (3)

### 3c. Add the game you want

Select the three dots next to the Path (1) and choose the Folder option. (2)  
Then choose the main folder for your game.  
{{< callout type="info" >}}  
You don't need to choose the folder where the .exe is located. Just choose the main folder for the game.

### 3d. Add the AppID

Press the `AppID Finder` (1), and then it will show a search menu. Make sure the App Name is correct (2) and select the right game (3). It might also show DLCs and demos, which can make it difficult to find the right one.  
You could also just add the AppID yourself if you know how to find it.

### 3e. Running SteamAutoCrack

Now you should be all set to go. Just press the `Start` button at the bottom.

You can check if it worked by finding a `steam_settings` folder in your game. It might be hidden somewhere, but when you find it, you should also find an `achievement_images` folder inside it.  

## 4. Achievement Watcher

Download Achievement Watcher from here  
<https://github.com/darktakayanagi/Achievement-Watcher/releases/latest>  
`Achievement.Watcher.Setup.x.x.xx.exe`  

Your games should pop up if you've played them with Goldberg.
